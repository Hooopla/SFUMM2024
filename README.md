Summary
"Dungeon" is a unique text-based game where players venture into a mysterious dungeon solo, each influencing the experience for the next player who enters. The goal is to navigate through a series of challenging rooms, indirectly helping one another to ultimately escape the dungeon. Players must strategize, solve puzzles, and make decisions that impact the environment for those who follow.

Gameplay:

- Players enter the dungeon one by one, starting with a basic character and limited supplies.
- Each room presents a new challenge of enemies. Ranging from bosses to normal enemies to character dialogue and more!
- Players must make decisions that affect subsequent players, like leaving behind helpful items or triggering mechanisms that open new paths.
- Actions in earlier rooms impact the layout or difficulty of later rooms, creating a dynamic and evolving experience.
- Collaboration between players is encouraged through indirect assistance mechanisms.
- The dungeon's complexity increases as more players enter, requiring strategic thinking and adaptation.
